# focus_project_Comp_Astro

Goal: Compare different PRNGs in terms of statistical properties and performance, and demonstrate their effect in a simulation (e.g., Monte Carlo or astrophysical model).

Decide on 2–3 PRNGs to implement:
1. Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
2. Mersenne Twister (via Python’s random)
3. Optional: PCG, xorshift, or a simple custom bitwise PRNG
